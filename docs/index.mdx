---

**MCP Agent** is a simple, composable framework for building AI agents using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). It implements [Anthropic's Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) patterns in a model-agnostic way, allowing you to create robust agent applications that can leverage any MCP-compatible tools and services.

## What is MCP Agent?

MCP Agent bridges the gap between the low-level [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and high-level agent patterns. It handles the complex mechanics of managing MCP server connections, tool orchestration, and workflow patterns so you can focus on building your application logic.

## Why MCP Agent?

### The MCP Ecosystem

As [more services become MCP-aware](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers), you can use MCP Agent to build agents that leverage these tools out-of-the-box. MCP Agent is the only framework purpose-built for the MCP protocol, making it the simplest way to build robust agent applications.

### Proven Patterns

MCP Agent implements every pattern from Anthropic's research on building effective agents:

## Quick Example

Here's a simple agent that can read files and fetch web content:

```python
import asyncio
from mcp_agent.app import MCPApp
from mcp_agent.agents.agent import Agent
from mcp_agent.workflows.llm.augmented_llm_openai import OpenAIAugmentedLLM

app = MCPApp(name="finder_agent")

async def main():
    async with app.run() as mcp_agent_app:
        # Create an agent with access to fetch and filesystem servers
        finder_agent = Agent(
            name="finder",
            instruction="You can read local files or fetch URLs. Return the requested information when asked.",
            server_names=["fetch", "filesystem"]
        )

        async with finder_agent:
            # Attach an LLM to the agent
            llm = await finder_agent.attach_llm(OpenAIAugmentedLLM)

            # Ask the agent to read a file
            result = await llm.generate_str("Show me what's in README.md")
            print(result)

            # Multi-turn conversation
            result = await llm.generate_str("Summarize that in a tweet")
            print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
